440c0407 MANY WANT TO STORM THE TANK AND TAKE IT OVER
440c0408 BUT IF THE HISTORY OF OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS IS ANY GUIDE WHITES INDIANS AND SMALL BLACK TRIBES SHOULD FEAR THAT
440c0409 GRAINS AND SOYBEANS MOST CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES PRICES WERE STRONGER
440c040a WHEAT FUTURES WERE SUPPORTED BY CONCERN THAT WHEAT MAY BE VULNERABLE IF COLD SNAPS FOLLOW THIS PAST WEEKEND'S WARMTH ANALYSTS SAID

440c040q IT MAY BE THAT OUR STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLICITY OF CORPORATIONS ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE FUTURE
440c040r NO FIRM PLAN HAS BEEN DEVISED BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO REVIEW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE HE SAID
440c040s THE PEOPLE'S PARTY CADRE MOVED INTO KEY POSITIONS IN AREAS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION LABOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AGRICULTURE

440c0411 SUMMITS HAVE THEIR POLITICAL BENEFITS OF COURSE NOT LEAST THAT THE PRESIDENT DOMINATES THE NEWS
440c0412 VICE PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANGE OF SUBJECT <NOISE> ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THE DRUMBEAT ABOUT PANAMA AND GENERAL NORIEGA
440c0413 BUT HAVING TALKED TO A VARIETY OF REPUBLICANS ABOUT THIS IN RECENT WEEKS I'M CONVINCED THAT MORE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS PARADOX OF DETENTE THAN PUBLICLY LET ON
440c0414 THERE'S NO DOUBT WE'VE DIMINISHED THE SOVIET THREAT VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR SAYS MINNESOTA REPRESENTATIVE VIN WEBER
440c0415 BUT THERE ARE ALSO RISKS
440c0416 TOO STEEP A FALL CAN MEAN HIGHER INFLATION AND EVENTUALLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES
440c0417 A LOWER DOLLAR ALSO MAKES IT CHEAPER FOR FOREIGNERS TO BUY U. S. ASSETS <NOISE> EVERYTHING FROM STOCKS AND BONDS TO REAL ESTATE AND CORPORATIONS
441c0401 MR. AZIZ A FORMER ENGLISH TEACHER IS ADEPT AT DELIVERING STRAIGHT TALK WITH DIPLOMATIC SMILES THAT SOFTEN THE HARSHNESS OF HIS WORDS

441c040p HE NOTED THAT LAST WEEK'S ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT DROP IN THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE RESULTED FROM A SLIGHTLY WEAKER DOLLAR
441c040q THE MARKETS TEND TO MAGNIFY THE NEWS
441c040r <NOISE> THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED SO BADLY LAST WEEK AND PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED SO WELL TO THIS
441c040s ASTRONOMERS SAY THAT THE EARTH'S FATE IS SEALED

442c040a THEY'VE LEARNED OF A BOOK DISTRIBUTED IN ANOTHER BOROUGH CALLED JESSE'S DREAM SKIRT ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO CHALLENGES SEXISM BY DRESSING AS A GIRL
442c040b THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAS GOTTEN USED TO ENJOYING SUCH LOONY LEFT STORIES AS PART OF ITS REGULAR NEWSPAPER DIET
442c040c BUT THERE'S AN UGLY SIDE TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT DESERVES CLOSER ATTENTION
442c040d U. S. EXPORTS ROSE IN THE MONTH BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS IMPORTS
442c040e STRONG IMPORTS HOWEVER MEAN THAT DOMESTIC DEMAND RIGHT NOW IS STRONG ONE SURE WAY TO CURB A TRADE DEFICIT IS TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN RECESSION
442c040f TRADE DEFICITS WEAKEN THE DOLLAR AS THEY DID LAST WEEK AND IN THE SHORT RUN A WEAKER DOLLAR MEANS MORE HELP FOR EXPORTS
442c040g IN THE LONGER RUN THE WEAK DOLLAR MAY MEAN MORE INFLATION AND TIGHT MONEY AND EVENTUALLY A RECESSION

443c040c <NOISE> THE ERROR WAS BY THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE
443c040d FOR MONTHS HE HAD SUFFERED NIGHT SWEATS FEVERS AND WEIGHT LOSS
443c040e SO FINALLY THE WORRIED NEW YORKER HAD HIS BLOOD TESTED FOR EVIDENCE OF THE AIDS VIRUS
443c040f THE RESULT WAS POSITIVE

443c0415 EDWARDS TENDS TO SELECT THE STOCKS OF RELATIVELY SMALL COMPANIES OFTEN NOT WIDELY FOLLOWED ON WALL STREET THAT MEET TRADITIONAL VALUE CRITERIA

444c040x RESPONSES TEND TO BE MUTED
444c040y WE'RE SEEING A RESPONSE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT'S CLEARLY TEMPERED BY NATURAL CONSERVATISM RIGHT NOW
444c040z I'M NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY WITH WHAT I'M SEEING
444c0410 NOT EVERYONE BUYS THE DEATH OF THE DOLLAR THESIS
444c0411 WHILE NOT RULING OUT THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY COULD DECLINE OVER TIME MR. LIPSKY OF SALOMON SAYS HE THINKS THE JURY IS STILL OUT
444c0412 HE ARGUES THAT FRIDAY'S UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES UNDERMINED THE THESIS OF A SHARPLY SLOWING ECONOMY
444c0413 HE ALSO SAYS THE AUTHORITIES MEAN WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT STAND ASIDE AND LET CURRENCIES REACH NEW LOWS POST ELECTION
444c0414 MR. VAGELOS SAID THAT IN ORDER TO MARKET THESE AND OTHER DRUGS MERCK PLANS TO INCREASE ITS SALES FORCE BY FIVE HUNDRED THIS YEAR
444c0415 SUCH JOBS ARE SEEN AS THE PLUM OF THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF MERCK'S EXTENSIVE LINE OF PRODUCTS
444c0416 THE PINK SHEET A DRUG INDUSTRY TRADE LETTER REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT MERCK HAD TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND APPLICATIONS FOR THE OPENINGS

445c0406 SOME INVESTORS ARE PREPARING FOR A SHORT TERM CORRECTION THIS MONTH ALTHOUGH MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WON'T BE SIGNIFICANT
445c0407 <NOISE> THE ARTICLE ALSO STATES USUALLY COMPANIES MUST KEEP PAYING WORKERS PARTICIPATING IN A SLOWDOWN BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOBS AND ADHERE TO THE RULES
445c0408 HOWEVER AS SUGGESTED LATER IN THE ARTICLE THE EMPLOYER MAY RESPOND WITH A LOCKOUT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF PAY
445c0409 ONLY A FEW STATES REQUIRE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION FOR LOCKED OUT WORKERS
445c040a FOR SUCH GROUP RATE COVERAGE EMPLOYERS CAN CHARGE THE FORMER WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE AVERAGE COST OF PROVIDING THE HEALTH BENEFITS PLUS A TWO PERCENT ADMINISTRATIVE FEE
445c040b IN MOST CASES THAT STILL WOULD BE LESS THAN THEY WOULD PAY FOR ARRANGING COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN
445c040c BUT SOME MAY BE BETTER OFF LOOKING FOR INSURANCE OUTSIDE THE EMPLOYER'S CONTINUED GROUP RATE PLAN
445c040d HOWEVER IN LIGHT OF THE STAKES ALREADY HELD BY THE VARIOUS FACTIONS ONLY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF GENERALE DE BELGIQUE'S SHARES APPEARED TO BE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET
445c040e THIS MEANS THAT FOR MR. DE BENEDETTI TO INCREASE HIS STAKE BY FIFTEEN PERCENT MEMBERS OF MR. LEYSEN'S GROUP WOULD HAVE TO SELL TO HIM
445c040f SOME SOURCES SAID SOME OF THE LESS TRADITIONAL HOLDERS OF GENERALE DE BELGIQUE'S SHARES COULD BE TEMPTED BY THE PROSPECT OF CAPITAL GAINS

445c040m IN JANUARY THE ARABIC SPEAKING MIDEAST EXPERT MR. MARTIROSOV ARRIVED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DELEGATION
445c040n HIS CREDENTIALS SUGGESTED THAT THE SOVIETS MIGHT HARBOR MORE INTEREST IN DIPLOMACY THAN REAL ESTATE
445c040o IF THE SOVIETS DECIDE TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE MISSION THEY NOW HAVE THE RIGHT GUY HERE SAYS THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL
445c040p NOW CIBA IS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
445c040q IT INVITED RESIDENTS TO JOIN A COMMITTEE TO AIR THEIR GRIPES AGAINST THE COMPANY AND DISCUSS SOLUTIONS
445c040r THE COMPANY ALSO DONATED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TO HIRE SPECIALISTS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES
445c040s THE CONSULTANTS NOTICED AN OMISSION IN THE PLANS THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR FEDERAL REGULATORS HAD SPOTTED
445c040t <NOISE> CIBA AGREED TO REMEDY THE OVERSIGHT
445c040u SEPARATELY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED SAID IT PLACED C. S. X. AND ITS TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDIARIES ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE BECAUSE OF C. S. X.'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN
445c040v THE RATING CONCERN ALSO PLACED THE SINGLE A TWO SENIOR DEBT RATING OF C. S. X.'S TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION UNIT ON REVIEW WITH DIRECTION UNCERTAIN
445c040w ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT IS UNDER REVIEW
445c040x BUT LOOK A LITTLE FURTHER THERE ARE WAYS AROUND HIRING FREEZES
445c040y IN A LOCAL PLANT THE MANUFACTURING MANAGER NEEDED ANOTHER FOREMAN A SALARIED POSITION BUT THERE WAS A FREEZE ON HIRING SALARIED PERSONNEL
445c040z SO AN HOURLY OPERATOR WAS PROMOTED TO FOREMAN BUT MAINTAINED ON THE HOURLY PAYROLL
445c0410 <NOISE> THE HEAD COUNT A BOGUS MEASURING DEVICE IF EVER THERE WAS ONE REMAINED THE SAME THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN SALARIED PERSONNEL
445c0411 NOT EVERYONE BUYS THE DEATH OF THE DOLLAR THESIS
445c0412 WHILE NOT RULING OUT THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY COULD DECLINE OVER TIME MR. LIPSKY OF SALOMON SAYS HE THINKS THE JURY IS STILL OUT
445c0413 HE ARGUES THAT FRIDAY'S UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES UNDERMINED THE THESIS OF A SHARPLY SLOWING ECONOMY
445c0414 HE ALSO SAYS THE AUTHORITIES MEAN WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT STAND ASIDE AND LET CURRENCIES REACH NEW LOWS POST ELECTION
446c0401 MR. BEESLEY NOW SAYS HE SOUGHT THE ACCOUNTING CHANGES BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOONER OR LATER WE WOULD NEED TAXPAYER MONEY
446c0402 HE ACKNOWLEDGES DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL OF SPEEDING UP LOSSES BUT DENIES MAKING ANY THREAT
446c0403 HOWEVER THE OTHER OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZE HIS MESSAGE AS LET US TRY SOME PHONY BALONEY ACCOUNTING OR WE CAN CAUSE CHAOS
446c0404 MR. SIMMONS COULDN'T IMMEDIATELY BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
446c0405 BUT HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK THAT HE COULD RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PRETTY FAST TO PURSUE AN ACQUISITION
446c0406 THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WILL TRY TO BUY MCDERMOTT
446c0407 IN RECENT YEARS HE HAS INVESTED IN G. A. F. CORPORATION AND LOUISIANA LAND AND EXPLORATION COMPANY AMONG OTHERS WITHOUT BIDDING TO ACQUIRE THEM
446c0408 AT HOME THE PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION HAS REBUKED THE AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL
446c0409 ANOTHER SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINISTRY HAS REPLIED TO THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA
446c040a AND THE PRESS SECRETARY TO THE MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION HAS RESPONDED TO NUMEROUS CRITICISMS
446c040b NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT
446c040c THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND ASK THEM THAT SAYS MR. APPELBAUM WHO ADDS THAT HIS HOME PHONE IS BUGGED
446c040d MEANTIME MORE DEPARTURES LOOM AND HE FEARS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS FADING
446c040e HIGHER INTEREST RATES OF COURSE COULD BE OFFSET BY HIGHER INFLATION
446c040f THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHAT THE BLUE CHIP ECONOMISTS EXPECT
446c040g BUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MR. GREENSPAN ARE LIKELY TO BE WORKING HARD TO KEEP INFLATION DOWN
446c040h THE NEW CHAIRMAN KNOWS THAT HIS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS MAKE SOME MARKET PARTICIPANTS SUSPICIOUS THAT HE WILL TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY TO HELP G. O. P. CANDIDATES NEXT YEAR
446c040i MITCHELL HELD AN ECONOMIST AT SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY THINKS MR. GREENSPAN WANTS TO ESTABLISH HIS CREDENTIALS AS AN INFLATION FIGHTER
446c040j AS SIGNS OF A STRONGER ECONOMY EMERGE HE ADDS LONG TERM RATES ARE LIKELY TO DRIFT HIGHER
446c040k SHORT TERM RATES HE SAYS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN STEADY OR MOVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER
446c040l UNDER TERMS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE ITALIAN AGRICULTURAL CONCERN ASSUMED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SUBORDINATED DEBT AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION

446c040n SHAMROCK HAS INTERESTS IN TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS ENERGY SERVICES REAL ESTATE AND VENTURE CAPITAL
446c040o IN ANY CASE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE SMOOTH TRANSITION THESIS
446c040p FOR ONE THING CONSUMERS MAY NOT BE QUITE READY TO QUIT SPENDING
446c040q THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SALES ARE SLOWING DOWN BUT CONSUMER CREDIT SURGED UPWARD IN DECEMBER
446c040r IF IT ISN'T ONE THING IT'S ANOTHER
446c040s I SEE BY THE PAPERS THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COMING BUDGET SURPLUS
446c040t THE WORRIES ARE OF TWO KINDS
446c040u ONE IS THAT WE WILL HAVE THE SURPLUS BUT SHOULDN'T
446c040v THE OTHER IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE SURPLUS BUT WON'T
446c040w YET EVEN AT EIGHTY SIX HE IS CONSIDERED THE COUNTRY'S MOST DYNAMIC POLITICAL FIGURE
446c040x HE'S THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD SHOW UP IN THE PLAZA AND DRAW A CROWD OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SAYS ONE LATIN DIPLOMAT
446c040y MR. EISENMANN THE OPPOSITION BUSINESSMAN SAYS ARNULFO ISN'T THE SOLUTION BUT THERE ISN'T ANY SOLUTION WITHOUT ARNULFO
446c040z AT FORTY YEARS OLD MR. WANG IS RELATIVELY YOUNG FOR HIS JOB AND THAT UPSETS COLLEAGUES WHO ARE USED TO A GRADUAL PROMOTION SYSTEM BASED ON SENIORITY
446c0410 SO MR. WANG TELLS PEOPLE HE IS FIFTY
446c0411 HIS M. B. A. ALSO IRKS SOME COLLEAGUES WHO ARE CONTEMPTUOUS OF FOREIGN CONCEPTS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAKE THEM WORK HARDER
446c0412 THE COST OF ANIMALS USED IN RESEARCH REPRESENTS ONLY ONE PERCENT TO TWO PERCENT OF TOTAL COSTS
446c0413 SO INCREASING THE COST OF ANIMALS WOULD NOT AFFECT THE BILL FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH SIGNIFICANTLY
446c0414 HOWEVER INCREASING THE COST OF RESEARCH ANIMALS SHOULD MOTIVATE RESEARCHERS NOT TO WASTE THEM ON MERELY CURIOUS OR REPETITIVE STUDIES
446c0415 IF SO THEN INCREASING THE COST OF RESEARCH ANIMALS SHOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THE BILL THE PUBLIC PAYS FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH
447c0401 MCDERMOTT AND N. L. ARE IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE OIL SERVICES BUSINESS
447c0402 N. L. SERVICES WELLS ONCE THEY ARE DRILLED WHILE MCDERMOTT BUILDS OFFSHORE DRILLING RIGS
447c0403 BUT BOTH COMPANIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM AN UPTURN IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS BUSINESS
447c0404 THRIFT NET WORTH
447c0405 ASSETS MINUS LIABILITIES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES
447c0406 THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WAS FOUR POINT SIX THREE PERCENT IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
447c0407 THRIFTS MUST MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF NET WORTH THAT IS AT LEAST THREE PERCENT OF THEIR LIABILITIES
447c0408 NEW FEDERAL RULES REQUIRE THRIFTS TO GRADUALLY RAISE THAT LEVEL DEPENDING ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY
447c0409 THE PROBLEM IS THAT PAN AM'S UNIONS HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN MR. ACKER AND CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THEY WON'T MAKE CONCESSIONS UNLESS HE IS REPLACED
447c040a PAN AM IS CLEARLY BANKING ON GETTING THOSE CONCESSIONS THIS YEAR AN EXECUTIVE AT ANOTHER AIRLINE SAYS
447c040b BUT ACKER'S CREDIBILITY HAS ERODED TO THE POINT THAT IF THEY PAN AM DIRECTORS DON'T GET RID OF ACKER THEY WON'T GET THOSE CONCESSIONS
447c040c THE WORKING PAPER'S OPTIONS FOR TAXING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INCLUDED LIMITING THE EXCLUSION OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE AND CAFETERIA PLAN BENEFITS
447c040d <NOISE> ALSO MENTIONED WAS A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL TO DENY THE DEDUCTION FOR TWENTY PERCENT OF CORPORATE ADVERTISING: COSTS AND TO REQUIRE INSTEAD THAT THEY BE AMORTIZED OVER TWO YEARS
447c040e IT HAS SOME APPEAL BECAUSE IT WOULD RAISE THIRTY SEVEN POINT NINE !BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS
447c040f WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT LEADS TO REAL DEMOCRACY SAYS JAIME BONILLA VICE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE INDEPENDENT LIBERAL PARTY
447c040g UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN NOTHING BUT STUNTS
447c040h AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH A LOT MORE OF THESE PUBLICITY MANEUVERS WITHOUT GIVING UP MUCH REAL GROUND
447c040i NAKASONE SELECTED NOBORU TAKESHITA TO SUCCEED HIM AS JAPAN'S PREMIER
447c040j THE CHOICE BY NAKASONE CAME AFTER THE FORMER FINANCE MINISTER AND HIS TWO RIVALS WERE DEADLOCKED OVER WHO SHOULD BE NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
447c040k BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONTROLS THE PARLIAMENT THE WINNER OF THE TOP PARTY POST ALSO BECOMES PRIME MINISTER
447c040l ALTHOUGH JAPAN'S POLICIES WON'T CHANGE RADICALLY UNDER TAKESHITA SIXTY THREE HIS LACK OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE COULD WORSEN JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

447c040n A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SAID THREE M. DECIDED TO RECALL ADDITIONAL MODELS OF ITS AIR IONIZERS AFTER RADIATION LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED AT FOUR FACILITIES USING THOSE MODELS
447c040o THE EXPANDED RECALL WAS DISCLOSED AT A MEETING WITH N. R. C. OFFICIALS AT AN AGENCY OFFICE OUTSIDE CHICAGO
447c040p MARKET ACTION WAS ESSENTIALLY DIGESTING WEDNESDAY'S RALLY
447c040q THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX OF FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT STOCKS CLOSED AT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX FIVE DOWN ZERO POINT ONE SIX
447c040r BUT SCORES OF SMALLER STOCKS ROSE AND SEVERAL OF THE BIGGER NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM ISSUES MANAGED GAINS AS WELL BECAUSE OF A KIND WORD FROM AN ANALYST
447c040s NARROWLY DEFINED THERE ARE A DOZEN OR SO ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS
447c040t ALTHOUGH MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN WEAK PERFORMERS THIS YEAR THAT HASN'T STOPPED OTHERS FROM TRYING TO CASH IN ON THE TERM'S NEW CACHET
447c040u <NOISE> EVERYONE'S RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO CALL THEMSELVES AN ALLOCATION FUND SAYS DON PHILLIPS EDITOR OF MUTUAL FUND VALUES A MUTUAL FUND ADVISORY SERVICE
447c040v <NOISE> NUCLEAR WEAPONS FREE ZONES ARE ATTRACTING INCREASING AND MISGUIDED PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY ATTENTION IN THE POST I. N. F. WESTERN WORLD
447c040w CREATING A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IS PARTLY A LOCAL DECISION CITIZENS OR GOVERNMENT IN A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREA DECIDE TO BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM THAT AREA
447c040x THEY CAN ALSO INVOLVE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION THE GOAL OFTEN IS TO GET FOREIGN STATES WITH NUCLEAR ARSENALS TO PLEDGE NOT TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST THE ZONE
447c040y IN ADDITION NUCLEAR FREE ZONES OFTEN INCLUDE ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEPLOYED ADJACENT TO THE ZONE ON LAND OR AT SEA BE PULLED BACK
447c040z YIELD MANAGEMENT ISN'T ALL BAD FOR CONSUMERS
447c0410 HOTELS CAN USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PREDICT WHEN BUSINESS WILL BE UNUSUALLY SLOW AND THUS WHEN MORE DISCOUNTING IS NEEDED
447c0411 AND SOME CHAINS SUCH AS HOLIDAY CORPORATION SHERATON CORPORATION AND HYATT HOTELS CORPORATION INSIST THEY WILL MAKE PLENTY OF ROOMS AVAILABLE AT BARGAIN RATES
447c0412 THE FEE ON THE GREEN OR BASIC CARD WILL JUMP TO FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS
447c0413 IT WAS LAST RAISED IN JUNE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE DOLLARS FROM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS
