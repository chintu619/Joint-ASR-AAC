4k4c0310 <NOISE> OTHERS LIKE HITACHI USE THE U. S. AS A BASE TO WOO NEW JAPANESE CUSTOMERS
4k4c0311 <NOISE> FOR EXAMPLE IT EXPECTS TO WIN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS OF SOME JAPANESE AUTO PARTS MAKERS THAT FOLLOWED NISSAN MOTOR COMPANY AND TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION ACROSS THE PACIFIC
4k4c0312 IT IS ALSO AIMING AT JAPANESE BANKS AND BROKERAGES SUCH AS NOMURA SECURITIES COMPANY THAT ARE REINFORCING U. S. OPERATIONS
4k4c0313 HIGHER FOOD PRICES OF COURSE BOOST THE COST OF LIVING FOR ALL AMERICANS
4k4c0314 EVERY THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN FOOD PRICES ADDS ABOUT HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
4k4c0315 <NOISE> ECONOMISTS ALREADY ARE ADDING BETWEEN THREE TENTHS AND SIX TENTHS PERCENTAGE POINT TO THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE INFLATION FORECASTS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT
4k4c0316 WE ALREADY HAVE AN INFLATION PROBLEM AND THIS DOESN'T HELP SAID JOEL POPKIN A PRIVATE ECONOMIST IN WASHINGTON
4k4c0317 BUT MR. GRZYWINSKI AND THREE OTHERS RAISED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM INVESTORS AND BORROWED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO BUY SOUTH SHORE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
4k4c0318 THE BANK HAS BEEN PROFITABLE SINCE THEN BUT NONE OF THE ORIGINAL FINANCIAL "QUOTE ANGELS "UNQUOTE HAS RECEIVED ANY DIVIDENDS
4k4c0319 THE PROFIT HAS BEEN PLOWED BACK INTO THE BANK WHICH HAS PURSUED ITS MISSION TO REBUILD A DECAYING NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A SINGULAR FOCUS
4k4c031a THE CHINESE ARE EAGER TO ESTABLISH JOINT VENTURES TO UTILIZE KOREAN TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERED MORE APPROPRIATE TO CHINA'S NEEDS THAN MORE SOPHISTICATED JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY
4k4c031b <NOISE> BUT ONLY A FEW KOREAN FIRMS HAVE MOVED TO INVEST
4k4c031c ONE SENIOR MANAGER AT A LARGE TRADING FIRM SAYS HE HAS BEEN VISITED BY EIGHT CHINESE DELEGATIONS IN THE PAST MONTH BUT HASN'T BEEN CONVINCED
4k4c031d MR. PAPANDREOU THEN A YOUTH WAS DINING WITH HIS FRIENDS AT A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT IN AN ATHENS SUBURB
4k4c031e <NOISE> WHEN THE FISH WAS SERVED THE YOUNG PAPANDREOU WITHOUT ASKING TOOK THE BIGGEST ONE
4k4c031f HIS FRIENDS PROTESTED
4k4c031g SO MR. PAPANDREOU GAVE THE FISH BACK BUT ONLY AFTER SPITTING ON IT
4k4c031h MR. GAGE THEN PUT THE QUESTION IF MR. PAPANDREOU EVER HAS TO GIVE UP GREECE WILL HE DO SO WILLINGLY OR WILL HE SPIT ON IT FIRST
4k6c0301 CURRENT FASHION SEEMS TO BE TO PREDICT MAN MADE ECOLOGICAL DISASTERS WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS AS ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS
4k6c0302 ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL DISASTERS HAVE A SOUND PHYSICAL BASIS AND NEED TO BE DISCUSSED SERIOUSLY
4k6c0303 IN ADDITION TO DEFORESTATION EXAMPLES ARE
4k6c0304 IN SOME CASES FINANCIAL PRESSURES AND POOR ACADEMIC PREPARATION ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS
4k6c0305 NONETHELESS SAYS PROFESSOR FLEMING HER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BLACK STUDENTS AT HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND WHITE STUDENTS AT PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS EXPERIENCE SIMILAR RATES OF ACADEMIC GROWTH
4k6c0306 BLACK STUDENTS AT WHITE SCHOOLS HOWEVER ACHIEVE ONLY HALF THAT RATE PROFESSOR FLEMING FINDS
4k6c0307 THE SYSTEM IS BORING AND BOREDOM LEADS TO DEGRADATION THE PRIEST SAYS WATCHING
4k6c0308 I WANT THEM TO SEE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR JOY
4k6c0309 BUT IN THE DARKNESS PAST THE CHURCH GATES APPLE WINE BOTTLES LITTER THE GROUND AND YOUNGSTERS ARE DRINKING THEMSELVES BLIND
4k6c030a IT LOOKS AS THOUGH FATHER SADLOWSKI HAS A LONG HAUL AHEAD OF HIM
4k6c030b THEN AGAIN HE HAS A LONG HAUL BEHIND HIM TOO
4k6c030c JAPANESE GOVERNMENT MINISTERS HAILED THE PACKAGE OF SPENDING MEASURES AND TAX CUTS TOTALING SIX TRILLION YEN FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS
4k6c030d AND INVESTOR OPTIMISM THAT THE PACKAGE WOULD SUCCEED SENT PRICES SURGING ON THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE
4k6c030e THE NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE CLOSED AT A RECORD
4k6c030f COHEN BROTHERS WON'T TALK ABOUT THE STANDOFF
4k6c030g BUT DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS THE DE- DEVELOPER TRIED TO GET MS. HERMAN OUT OF THE BUILDING BY OFFERING HER THE CHOICE OF OTHER APARTMENTS
4k6c030h HER LAWYER SUGGESTED SHE TAKE ONE THREE BLOCKS AWAY
4k6c030i SHE BALKED
4k6c030j SHE ALSO REFUSED CASH OFFERS TO RELOCATE INCLUDING ONE FOR SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
4k6c030k THE SALES RESULTS SO FAR ARE TOO EARLY TO JUDGE SINCE THE CARS WENT ON SALE JUST OVER A MONTH AGO
4k6c030l BUT CHRYSLER OFFICIALS EXPRESS OPTIMISM
4k6c030m THEY'RE GOING OUT THE DOOR JUST AS FAST AS THEY HIT THE DEALERSHIPS SAYS MRS. TOROK
4k6c030n THE ORDER BACKLOG IS EXTREMELY STRONG WELL INTO NEXT YEAR
4k6c030o YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS MARK THE LONGEST STRIDE YET IN A CAMPAIGN BY THE RIKSBANK TO DISMANTLE A RANGE OF FINANCIAL CONTROLS IMPOSED AT THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR TWO
4k6c030p THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT PLEDGED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO BEGIN A PROGRAM OF GRADUALLY LIBERALIZING THE CONTROLS
4k6c030q IN JUNE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE RIKSBANK REMOVED A REQUIREMENT THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS BY SWEDISH COMPANIES BE FINANCED ENTIRELY BY LONG TERM FOREIGN BORROWING
4k6c030r EARLIER THIS YEAR THE CENTRAL BANK ALLOWED EMPLOYEES OF FOREIGN COMPANIES TO BUY THEIR EMPLOYERS' STOCK AND AUTHORIZED FOREIGNERS TO TRADE IN SWEDISH SHARE OPTIONS
4k6c030s THE CONTRAS PARTICULARLY APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT ON
4k6c030t THEY HAVE SPENT SEVEN YEARS AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN U. S. AID BUILDING THE AREA'S BIGGEST INSURGENT FORCE
4k6c030u NOW AT THEIR FIGHTING PEAK THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND BECOME POLITICIANS
4k6c030v UNFORTUNATELY THIS THEORY ISN'T CONSISTENT WITH REALITY
4k6c030w THE CONCEPT OF RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS DOESN'T APPLY WHEN THOSE EXPECTATIONS RELATE TO EVENTS THAT ARE THEMSELVES CONTINGENT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DECISIONS
4k6c030x THE EVENTS CEASE TO BE UNIQUELY DETERMINED AND PARTICIPANTS ARE CONFRONTED WITH GENUINE UNCERTAINTY
4k6c030y THEY ARE FORCED TO TAKE A VIEW AND THE BIAS THEY BRING TO BEAR PLAYS A ROLE IN THE OUTCOME
4k6c030z UNHAMPERED BY GLASS STEAGALL THE BANK BOARD SAID IT WOULD ALLOW STATESMAN'S SECURITIES AND THRIFT BUSINESSES TO MARKET EACH OTHER'S PRODUCTS
4k6c0310 IT IMPOSED TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS ON CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS FOR SIX MONTHS BETWEEN THE TWO ACTIVITIES WHILE IT CONSIDERS WHAT LONG TERM RESTRICTIONS ARE NEEDED
4k6c0311 MS. COHEN SAID THE TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS INCLUDED A BAR AGAINST THE SECURITIES FIRM PASSING ON INSIDER INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIES DEALS BUT SHE LACKED FURTHER I- DETAILS
4k6c0312 THE RULES PROPOSED BY U. S. BANK REGULATORS WOULD COUNT ONLY COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AS TIER ONE CAPITAL
4k6c0313 MOST OF THE LARGEST U. S. INTERNATIONAL BANKS FALL SHORT OF THE FOUR PERCENT GOAL AND EVEN THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT INTERIM TARGET FOR NINETEEN NINETY
4k6c0314 THEY WOULD HAVE TO BUILD ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SHAREHA- -HOLDER EQUITY TO MEET THE PROPOSED ULTIMATE STANDARD THE LAWMAKERS CLAIMED
4k6c0315 FOR EXAMPLE IT EARNS A PRO:FIT ON PRODUCT SALES TO THE DEALERS RATHER THAN FROM ROYALTY SALES
4k6c0316 IN ADDITION ITS DEALERS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN BUSINESS AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS SELL OTHER PRODUCT LINES BESIDES THOSE PROVIDED BY INTELLIGENT ELECTRONICS
4k6c0317 TYPICALLY SALES OF THE COMPANY'S COMPUTER AND PERIPHERAL OFFERINGS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF A DEALER'S TOTAL VOLUME
4k6c0318 A SPOKESMAN FOR PEPSICO INCORPORATED SAID WE HAVE NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO GO TO SUCROSE
4k6c0319 HOWEVER PEPSI IS ALWAYS EXPLORING DIFFERENT MORE ECONOMIC WAYS TO SWEETEN OUR DRINKS
4k6c031a IF THE PRICE OF SUCROSE BECOMES COMPETITIVE WITH HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP WE'D CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS
4k6c031b SUCROSE IS A SUGAR EXTRACTED FROM SUGAR CANE OR SUGAR BEETS
4k6c031c THE PAPERS COMPRISE THE PUBLIC RECORD OF THE PENNZOIL VERSUS
4k6c031d TEXACO LITIGATION IN HOUSTON PLUS ITS APPEALS AND RELATED LITIGATION IN DELAWARE AND OKLAHOMA
4k6c031e ALSO INCLUDED ARE PORTIONS OF TEXACO'S BANKRUPTCY CASE THAT RELATE TO THE ORIGINAL LAWSUIT AND VERDICT MR. SHADDIX SAYS
4k7c0301 LEAR SIEGLER DIDN'T IDENTIFY POSSIBLE BIDDERS OR SET A TIMETABLE FOR TAKING ACTION
4k7c0302 THE COMPANY'S ADVISERS ARE DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
4k7c0303 A LEAR SIEGLER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT
4k7c0304 AND WHILE PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO COLD AIR OR WATER CAN BE FATAL MOST VICTIMS OF THE TITANIC DIED OF HYPOTHERMIA BRIEF ENCOUNTERS MAY ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL
4k7c0305 MR. POZOS NOTES THAT SCANDINAVIANS HAVE BEEN RUNNING OUT OF SAUNAS AND PLUNGING INTO ICY WATERS FOR YEARS
4k7c0306 IF IT HADN'T BEEN GOOD FOR THEM HE SAYS THEY'D ALL BE DEAD
4k7c0307 HOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY WILL BEAR ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS LIKELY TO COME TO A HEAD IN CONGRESS THIS FALL IS A GOOD QUESTION
4k7c0308 ONE ARGUMENT MOST LIKELY WILL BE THAT THE IMPROVEMENT MAKES IT SAFER FOR THE TREASURY TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT
4k7c0309 THE CONTRARY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE BANKS ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO DEAL WITH THEIR OWN WOES
4k7c030a CONSUMER SPENDING SURGED POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN JUNE LED BY A JUMP IN AUTO SALES
4k7c030b DESPITE THE UNEXPECTED STRENGTH ECONOMISTS SAY SPENDING WILL SLOW SOON DUE TO SLUGGISH INCOME GROWTH RISING PRICES AND HIGH CONSUMER DEBT
4k7c030c INCOME ROSE POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
4k7c030d EDWARD S. BUCHANAN PRESIDENT OF BROCKTON MASSACHUSETTS BASED MASSACHUSETTS BANK AND TRUST COMPANY AND A MAJOR UNION WARREN SHAREHOLDER IS ALSO CLINGING TO THAT VIEW
4k7c030e LAWYERS WHO HAVE READ THE AGREEMENT CLOSELY SAY THAT IT APPEARS THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR HOME OWNERS ACCORDING TO MR. BUCHANAN
4k7c030f HE HAS TRIMMED HIS NINE POINT ONE PERCENT STAKE IN UNION WARREN SINCE THE JANUARY AGREEMENT BUT SAYS HE STILL HOLDS MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT OF THE THRIFT'S SHARES
4k7c030g DEATH IS THE KEY WORD SAID ONE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR WITH I. C. N.
4k7c030h THERE ARE SOME KEY SHARES IN SOME VERY AGED HANDS AND THE FATE OF THIS COMPANY HINGES ON THOSE SHARES
4k7c030i I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BUY THEM TODAY BUT THINGS CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE DIE
4k7c030j IF THE FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD MR. WYNN IS WORRIED HE HIDES IT WELL
4k7c030k THE SECRET TO THE PROJECT'S SUCCESS HE SAYS CONFIDENTLY WILL BE ITS ABILITY TO CREATE EXCITEMENT
4k7c030l THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER CASINO IN LAS VEGAS MR. WYNN SAYS
4k7c030m BUT THEY SURE AS HELL COULD USE A MAJOR ATTRACTION HERE AND THIS HOTEL WILL BE LIKE DISNEYLAND IS TO ANAHEIM
4k7c030n THIS WILL BE A RESORT THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A CASINO ATTACHED
4k7c030o BUT AFTER THE PRINCESS IS SPOTTED IN HER HAT THE STAKES RISE
4k7c030p THERE ARE GOOD NATURED CONFRONTATIONS WITH SCOTLAND YARD DETECTIVES BLOCKING SIDE ROADS
4k7c030q BUT THE ROYALS ARE SIGHTED ONLY IN THE DISTANCE
4k7c030r MR. MURDOCH'S AUSTRALIA BASED NEWS CORP. CONTROLS FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF THE VOTING STOCK IN COLLINS A U. K. PUBLISHER
4k7c030s LAST MARCH NEWS CORP. PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR HARPER AND ROW AND BROUGHT IN COLLINS EXECUTIVES TO MANAGE THE COMPANY
4k7c030t THEN IN SEPTEMBER NEWS CORP. SOLD A FIFTY PERCENT STAKE IN HARPER AND ROW TO COLLINS FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
4k7c030u <NOISE> MANY SHAREHOLDERS WERE UNHAPPY WITH GILLETTE'S PURCHASE OF REVLON'S SHARES WHICH THEY CONSIDERED TO BE GREENMAIL
4k7c030v IN A SIGN OF THEIR DISPLEASURE HOLDERS VOTED IN FAVOR OF A PROPOSAL AT THE ANNUAL MEETING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT FUTURE GREENMAIL PAYMENTS BY GILLETTE
4k7c030w OF THE SHARES VOTED FIFTY FOUR PERCENT WERE CAST IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL FORTY FOUR PERCENT AGAINST AND THE REST ABSTAINED
4k7c030x THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT IS IN DEFAULT UNDER CERTAIN COVENANTS OF A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH MARINE MIDLAND BANKS INC.
4k7c030y THAT AGREEMENT COVERS A LETTER OF CREDIT IN CONNECTION WITH INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND FINANCING
4k7c030z ZENITH SAID SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IS OUTSTANDING
4k7c0310 THE COMPANY SAID MARINE MIDLAND HASN'T INSTITUTED ANY LEGAL ACTION
4k7c0311 A MARINE MIDLAND SPOKESMAN SAID THE BANK DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS CUSTOMER MATTERS
4k7c0312 TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN SEEMS TO BE THE MESSAGE SENT TO MANAGERS OF COMPANIES BEING BOUGHT OUT CONSULTANT SIBSON AND COMPANY SAYS
4k7c0313 FOUR OF FIVE ACQUIRING COMPANIES PAY CASH FOR STOCK OPTIONS THAT EXECUTIVES HOLD IN THEIR OLD FIRMS LEAVING THEM LITTLE INCENTIVE TO LINGER SIBSON SAYS
4k7c0314 ONLY ONE IN FIVE OFFERS OPTIONS IN THE NEW PARENT
4k7c0315 THE LOS ANGELES BASED DEFENSE CONTRACTOR WHICH HADN'T DISCLOSED TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT DIDN'T SAY WHY THE AGREEMENT FELL THROUGH
4k7c0316 SECURITIES ANALYSTS HAD ESTIMATED THAT THE SALE PRICE WAS SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
4k7c0317 NORTHROP WORLDWIDE WAS TO HAVE BEEN OPERATED BY A NEW COMPANY FORMED BY CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS AND LOS ANGELES BASED MATRIX EQUITY GROUP INC.
4k7c0318 JAMES STEINBERG MR. DUKAKIS'S AIDE ON DEFENSE ISSUES SAID THE MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR OPPOSED THE G. W. E. N. SYSTEM ON BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATEGIC GROUNDS
4k7c0319 WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION BEGAN TO SELL G. W. E. N. TO THE CONGRESS THEY REPEATEDLY CALLED IT A SYSTEM FOR PROTRACTED NUCLEAR WAR FIGHTING MR. STEINBERG SAID
4k7c031a DUKAKIS BELIEVES WE NEED SURVIVABLE COMMUNICATIONS AND THAT AN APPROPRIATE SYSTEM TO LET US RETALIATE IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE
4k7c031b BUT HIS OBJECTION IN ADDITION TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS DEVELOPING A STRATEGY TO MOUNT AND SURVIVE MULTIPLE NUCLEAR STRIKES
4k7c031c WITHOUT UNIFORM STANDARDS THERE'S A VERY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CHEAT ON LABELING SAYS DAVID DIVER DIRECTOR OF PRODUCE FOR HANNAFORD BROTHERS
4k7c031d COMPANY A PORTLAND MAINE RETAILER
4k7c031e IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT ANY DEFINITION OF WHAT'S ORGANIC ENABLES THE CONSUMER TO GET WHAT THEY REALLY THINK THEY'RE BUYING
4k8c0301 DESPITE THE ADVANTAGES FOR SOUTH AFRICA OF CONTINUED RENAMO SUCCESSES PRETORIA STRIDENTLY DENIES THAT IT AIDS THE REBELS
4k8c0302 INDEED IT SAYS IT WANTS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC TIES WITH THE MOZAMBIQUE GOVERNMENT NOW HEADED BY JOAQUIM CHISSANO
4k8c0303 BESIDES SAYS A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL RENAMO ISN'T HARD UP FOR FINANCIAL HELP
4k8c0304 IT HAS A HARD TIME USING UP WHAT IT HAS
4k8c0305 THE OFFICIAL SAID THE TREASURY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND A SPECIFIC REVENUE INITIATIVE TO PAY FOR THE MULTINATIONAL PROPOSAL
4k8c0306 HIS PLAN WOULD COST THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH STARTS OCTOBER FIRST
4k8c0307 <NOISE> THE WALLOP PROPOSAL WOULD COST FIVE POINT FOUR TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS
4k8c0308 OUT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN'S SPECTACULAR WORLD WIDE SURGE IN STOCK PRICES HAS COME A DEEPENING CONTROVERSY OVER WHETHER U. S. STOCKS ARE OVERPRICED
4k8c0309 ONE CONTROVERSY BREEDS ANOTHER IN THIS CASE A SIDE ARGUMENT OVER WHETHER INFLATION IS STILL BLOWING FROTH INTO U. S. CORPORATE EARNINGS
4k8c030a BUT THIS S:CRUTINY OF THE QUALITY OF EARNINGS IS UNCOVERING A MORE TROUBLING PHENOMENON
4k8c030b LIQUIDATIONS AND LAYOFFS ARE BEEFING UP THE BOTTOM LINE
4k8c030c COST REDUCTION IS NO CLARION CALL TO INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN MANAGEMENT PLANNING
4k8c030d IT SUGGESTS COSTLY WRONG TURNS
4k8c030e HOW COULD YOU THINK I'D DO SUCH A THING AS TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION
4k8c030f MR. BOESKY SAID AT THE TIME
4k8c030g AND IF I DID HOW COULD YOU THINK I'D BE DUMB ENOUGH TO DO IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
